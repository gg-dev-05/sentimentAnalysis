Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful.\n","I ordered the Amazon 5W USB Official OEM Charger and Power Adapter for Fire Tablets and Kindle eReaders however, what I received is nothing like what is pictured. I received a charger cord that states LG Electronics and Verizon Accessory. I am not certain that these are the same item.\n","20 for a USB charger is outrageous! It should have bee free with the Paperwhite Kindle.\n","Overall the tablet is okay, I just paid 50$ so can't complain anything about specs but the fact that you can't use google services sucks. No google, no youtube, gmail!\n","Bought this tablet for my daughter. It was very hard to figure out how to switch to the kids profile. She used it for maybe a day and when we went to charge it the cable just fell out and wouldn't actually charge.\n","Price is low, but OS is lacking unlike other brands it doesnt come with a decent charger. To refill battery you have to charge it overnight.\n","It came with dead pixels so i was very disappointed. i called then they replaced it. I ended up returning it completely because it was too slow.\n","Not user friendly, in regards to compatibility with Google Play services, Play Store, etc. Definitely needs to be improved upon\n","This is the possibly the best Tablet if you are an Amazon store/prime centric user. But, it doesn't include the Google Play Store and doesn't include most / any of the Google apps, which are stables in the Tablet world. No Google Inbox, etc. For me, this tablet is a \"skip\". But, it's cheap and if it meets your needs you might love it.\n","Initially I bought this for my son and he's been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue I have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and it's very difficult to insert the charger easily I may have a defective unit which I may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better\n","It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????\n","All I can say, as soon as I opened this tablet it never ever turned on, I was so upset as I've followed the troubleshooting steps from other users online and still it never worked, I fully charged the tablet and tried again and still it never turned on. I had a very hard time at the best buy returning this item; had to spend an hour and explained the situation to them; they never believed me this item came to be defective; after storming out and after a while; they have decided to accept the return and gave me credit for it.I would never buy an Amazon product ever again. piece of junk, bad quality product.Thanks,\n","Very slow, freezes frequently but it was 34 dollars\n","It's continent for my son but is too slow to connect to wifi\n","I purchased this item on sale as an alternative tab to android RC tablet. Fire tab is extremely slow, my son had been using RC tablet without any problem, but this one is slow, takes forever the web page to load, apps are also slow. Absolutely waste of money.\n","Very slow to connect to internet even with a good connection and wifi set up that worked for other electronics.\n","I was a bit disappointed by the lack of the Android play store, navigation on it is a pain.\n","I bought this hoping that I could use it for a book reader and other lightweight tasks. The wifi is very slow and the tablet in general is slow and hangs to much\n","My girls were super excited to get their Fires for Christmas! Unfortunately, one of them stopped recognizing the touch screen after an hour of opening. Amazon was kind enough to send us a new one direct with a return label so returning it was simple! Crossing my fingers still though!\n","pretty slow, but for the price i guess it works ok\n","I returned and got the 8\" since this turned this product and would not turn on. I got another since it was a gift.\n","Bought this for my mom. The touchscreen is not as responsive as my iPad. The camera is a little underpowered too. I didn't think it would matter much, but it is pretty pixelated. It serves her purposes and I knew it wasn't a high end device going in. She has been able to fumigate it out mostly, so that's been a bonus.\n","Its good for the price. Amazon store is not as huge as Android play store\n","The processor was so slow. It took about five minutes to load a five minute YouTube video with 50 Mb/min. Internet.\n","Not a bad basic tablet but is slow when loading apps\n","The tablet would never turn on, even after charging\n","Has lots of ads and seems to be a little slow in response. Bought for my kids and they like it so I'm ok with it.\n","I actually ended up returning this item because I got frustrated with the adds. If it wasn't for that I probably would have given it 5 stars.\n","Like most Androd devices, has slowed down considerably over time since purchase. Nice for video watching but browsing the Internet is slow at times. Apps take awhile to load good for the price\n","Its ok for the price if willing to deal with the ads and cant download certain apps.\n","very slow device for most adults. probably fine for a child\n","Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.\n","It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk.\n","Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing\n","So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions\n","Slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. User I nterface is ok. Really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. Next time I'll just spend the additional money on an iPad mini for my kids.\n","It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.\n","I cannot believe i bought this junk. It's always in freezing mode and i have to reboot it multiple times within a given hour. None of the apps work properly. I have tried to update the op. system, but that didnt help.\n","Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times\n","It's was on sale on this color,put the play store and made it real Android tablet\n","This works very well for a reader but if you want to browse online it is not so good. The default Silk browser is slow; side loaded Opera and it is slow; Chrome is slow and Firefox is slow. So I have to assume that it is the Fire that is slow WiFi / browsing. But then it was an inexpensive piece of hardware.\n","Poor response. Very sluggish. Even the Amazon app is slow. Not so on my Apple or Droid tablets. I've yet to load any apps.\n"]}],"source":["def warn(*args, **kwargs):\n","    pass\n","import warnings\n","warnings.warn = warn\n","\n","for i in arr:\n","  if(test(i)[0] != 1):\n","    print(i)"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
